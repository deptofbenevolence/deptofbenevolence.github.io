# The Department of Strategic Benevolence

**A satirical writing and web project exploring authoritarianism, collapse, and utopia—through the dry, euphemistic language of fictional bureaucracy.**

## What Is This?

This project is an outlet for processing the strange, often disturbing realities of our current political and social era—using dark humor and dystopian satire as a form of emotional survival, creative expression, and critique. It combines the aesthetics of government formalism with themes of climate catastrophe, economic injustice, systemic failure, and the slow death of democratic norms.

It’s meant to be funny. And unsettling. And sometimes cathartic.

## The Premise

Set in an alternate timeline, the project diverges from our own world in **July 2024**, following the real-world U.S. Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity (*Trump v. United States*). In this parallel universe, President Biden fully embraces the ruling’s implications—becoming **Dark Brandon incarnate**—and establishes a benevolent, left-wing authoritarian regime.

In this reality, **The Department of Strategic Benevolence (DSB)** is formed as the institutional engine of systemic overhaul. Its mission is to end wealth inequality, guarantee healthcare and education, expand the social safety net, and forcibly redistribute power and resources—always through euphemistic memos, procedural edicts, and the terrifying calm of technocratic language.

DSB is a satire of power and a fantasy of justice, rooted in bureaucratic absurdity.

## The Website

The current DSB website is a satirical artifact: it publishes daily posts, styled as formal agency memos, that document the activities and ideology of the Department. These posts reflect real-world events—climate collapse, economic precarity, the erosion of civil liberties—through the lens of a fictional government that claims to fix it all, while quietly reorganizing society in unsettling ways.

While primarily humorous, the long-term goal is to **embed real policy ideas and critiques into the satire**, using fiction as a gateway to serious thinking. Think *Swift’s Modest Proposal*, but with more budget spreadsheets.
