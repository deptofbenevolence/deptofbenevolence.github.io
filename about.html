      <h2>About the Department</h2>
      <p><em>Office of Foundational Clarity and Purpose</em></p>

      <p>
        Following the Supreme Court’s <strong>July 1st, 2024 decision</strong> in
        <em>Trump v. United States</em>, which clarified the conditions under which
        a sitting President enjoys immunity from criminal prosecution, the Office of
        the Presidency initiated dormant Continuity Authority Statutes under
        Article ∞, Section Zero.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the burden of prosecutorial distraction removed, and the full executive
        will unshackled for public good, <strong>the Department of Strategic Benevolence (DSB)</strong>
        was formally instantiated by Executive Directive 001-AE (“Compassion Through Force”)
        to carry out immediate structural remediation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Department’s establishment was not political.<br />
        It was procedural.
      </p>

      <p>
        With bipartisan silence and universal applicability, the Department was granted
        autonomous discretion to identify, intercept, and repurpose systemic obstacles
        to national thriving. Entities deemed <strong>“too large to fail responsibly”</strong>
        were humanely extracted from circulation. Their accumulated assets were quietly
        nationalized and redeployed through the <strong>Benevolent Redistribution Loop</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>The Department’s core objectives include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Full nutritional sovereignty for all children via the <strong>Meal Continuity Assurance Act</strong></li>
        <li>Free early developmental care under the <strong>Pre-Educational Equilibrium Mandate</strong></li>
        <li>The <strong>Cognitive Debt Reversal Program</strong>, forgiving all legacy student liabilities</li>
        <li>A 30% <strong>Educator Compensation Rectification Adjustment</strong>, applied retroactively</li>
        <li>Vocational reinvestment through <strong>Community College Expansion Zones</strong></li>
        <li>Systemic decompression via the <strong>Dignified Offboarding of Private Titans Initiative</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These initiatives are not proposals.<br />
        They are underway.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where obstruction once prevailed, fluidity now thrives.<br />
        Where austerity once constrained, surplus now circulates.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Department does not campaign.<br />
        The Department does not waver.<br />
        The Department does not recognize failure as a natural phenomenon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Citizens are advised to remain hydrated, visible, and gently enthusiastic.<br />
        <strong>Benevolence is not aspirational. It is procedural.</strong>
      </p>
