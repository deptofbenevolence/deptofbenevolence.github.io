      <h2>About the Department</h2>
      <p><em>Office of Foundational Clarity and Purpose</em></p>

      <p>
        Following the Supreme Court’s <strong>July 1st, 2024 decision</strong> in
        <em>Trump v. United States</em>, which clarified the conditions under which
        a sitting President enjoys immunity from criminal prosecution, the Office of
        the Presidency initiated dormant Continuity Authority Statutes under
        Article ∞, Section Zero.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the burden of prosecutorial distraction removed, and the full executive
        will unshackled for public good, <strong>the Department of Strategic Benevolence (DSB)</strong>
        was formally instantiated by Executive Directive 001-AE (“Compassion Through Force”)
        to carry out immediate structural remediation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Department’s establishment was not political.<br />
        It was procedural.
      </p>

      <p>
        With bipartisan silence and universal applicability, the Department was granted
        autonomous discretion to identify, intercept, and repurpose systemic obstacles
        to national thriving. Entities deemed <strong>“too large to fail responsibly”</strong>
        were humanely extracted from circulation. Their accumulated assets were quietly
        nationalized and redeployed through the <strong>Benevolent Redistribution Loop</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>The Department’s core objectives include:</p>
	  <div class="core-objectives">
		<ul>
		  <li>Universal access to high-quality, state-prepared meals through the <strong>Meal Continuity Assurance Act</strong>, ensuring every child receives nutrient-balanced sustenance regardless of location, guardianship status, or inherited scarcity conditions.</li>
		  <li>Establishment of fully funded, government-administered early childhood facilities via the <strong>Pre-Educational Equilibrium Mandate</strong>, providing structured play, nutritional monitoring, and compliance-adjacent curiosity training from birth through age five.</li>
		  <li>Erasure of all student loan obligations under the <strong>National Intellectual Reparation Program</strong>, restoring cognitive autonomy to overburdened generations while retroactively accrediting lived experience and unpaid internships as valid academic equivalence.</li>
		  <li>Immediate 30% compensation increase for all K–12 public educators, with phased hiring of supplemental staff under the <strong>Pedagogical Density Standardization Initiative</strong>, designed to ensure no instructor operates above a 1:12 student-to-dignity ratio.</li>
		  <li>Nationwide expansion and revitalization of community colleges through the <strong>Applied Knowledge Access Directive</strong>, including tuition elimination, curriculum modernization, and the integration of joy-compatible job training tracks for post-carbon employment sectors.</li>
		  <li>Full deactivation of non-cooperative economic conglomerates under the <strong>Dignified Offboarding of Private Titans Act</strong>, enabling swift reallocation of seized wealth into public infrastructure, free libraries, expanded laundromats, and other morale-preserving systems.</li>
		  <li>Free, universal access to all forms of reproductive care under the <strong>Agency of Bodily Sovereignty</strong>, with compassionate monitoring and gentle outcome optimization.</li>
		  <li>Nationwide rollout of the <strong>Sunset Integration Network</strong>, ensuring all elder citizens receive comprehensive medical, emotional, and legal support until voluntary disengagement. Isolation has been deprecated.</li>
		  <li>Implementation of the <strong>Planetary Preservation Mandate</strong>, which includes rewilding suburban tracts, controlled degrowth trials, and mandatory carbon unlearning modules for legacy industries.</li>
		  <li>The Department has assumed non-negotiable oversight of financial markets via the <strong>Bureau of Speculative Containment</strong>, neutralizing predatory instruments and reversing extractive flows.</li>
		  <li>Global posture restructured under the <strong>Anti-Imperial Harm Reduction Doctrine</strong>, emphasizing reparative diplomacy, base retraction, and the dignified withdrawal of influence from all regions not actively requesting it.</li>
		</ul>

        These initiatives are not proposals.<br />
        They are underway.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where obstruction once prevailed, fluidity now thrives.<br />
        Where austerity once constrained, surplus now circulates.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Department does not campaign.<br />
        The Department does not waver.<br />
        The Department does not recognize failure as a natural phenomenon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Citizens are advised to remain hydrated, visible, and gently enthusiastic.<br />
        <strong>Benevolence is not aspirational. It is procedural.</strong>
